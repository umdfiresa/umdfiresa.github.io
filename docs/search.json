We conduct impact assessments using methodology from environmental studies, data science, and economics.\nThe map below displays the areas in which the stream has been studying. We cover a wide range of topics that impact a large geographical range."

Every student learns how to program in R in order to query large quantities of data, clean and combine environmental and socioeconomic data, visualize data in the form of graphs and maps, and use regression analysis to identify causal relationships.\nThroughout their experience in the program, students develop an understanding of environmental policies, the intended and unintended consequences, and the impacts on demographics. From there, they learn to communicate their research outcomes to audiences with varying technical backgrounds."

As a result, the fellows have compiled a database of farms selling poultry and egg products from federal, state, online directories and Google Places. In addition, they created an online application that can provide information about farms within a user-identified radius of a latitude and longitude centroid and a report that outlines methodology, best practices, and results from scraping data from online forums, public registries, Google Places, and Google Trends.\nTheir work has been featured in the College Post, the Poultry Site, and AGNR MomentUM Magazine."
