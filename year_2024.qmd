## Summer Undergraduate Research Conference

For eight weeks, FIRE Sustainability Analytics interns studied the impact of light rail openings in four cities: Charlotte, NC, Phoenix-Mesa, AZ, Houston, TX, and Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN. They used the Discontinuity Based Ordinary Least Squares Model, similar to [Chen & Whalley (2012](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles/pdf/doi/10.1257/pol.4.1.58)), to study the impact of light rail openings on air quality. Afterward, they used demographic data to analyze the potential causes of public transit adoption. Their posters are displayed at [UMD's Summer Undergraduate Research Conference](https://our.umd.edu/surc), and links to their GitHub-Flavored Markdown Page are shown below.
