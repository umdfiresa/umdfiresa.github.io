In May 2020, US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) funded four FIRE Sustainability Analytics students, Janna Chapman, Anna Lazarus-Hall, Shanil Kothari, and Mishti Relan, Summer Fellowships, to work on the project "Using Online Data to Identify Farms Selling Poultry and Eggs in Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. As a result, the fellows have compiled a database of farms selling poultry and egg products from federal, state, online directories and Google Places. In addition, they created an online application that can provide information about farms within a user-identified radius of a latitude and longitude centroid and a report that outlines methodology, best practices, and results from scraping data from online forums, public registries, Google Places, and Google Trends.

Their work has been featured in the [College Post](https://thecollegepost.com/maryland-students-app-chicken-farms/), [the Poultry Site](https://www.thepoultrysite.com/news/2021/01/interdisciplinary-university-student-team-works-to-improve-poultry-biosecurity-through-data-science), and AGNR MomentUM Magazine.
