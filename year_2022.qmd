## Posters on the Hill

Every year the Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR) hosts the event [Posters on the Hill](https://www.cur.org/what/events/students/poh/) to give undergraduates the opportunity to present their research on Capitol Hill so Congress members can interact with the students and appreciate the importance of undergraduate research. This year, research from the stream has the opportunity to represent the state of Maryland during this event.
